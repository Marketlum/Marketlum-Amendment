## Preamble

This document is an amendment to the Holacracy® Constitution. For more information, please see <a rel="license" href="https://holacracy.org">holacracy.org</a>.

The Organization and its Partners steward a space for creating and exchanging Value among Agents, the ***"Market"***.

## Article 1: Value

### 1.1 Value Definition

Value created by the Agents is anything of importance, worth or usefulness. It is defined as:

- **(a)** a descriptive name.
- **(b)** a ***“Purpose”***, which is a capacity, potential, or goal that the Organization realizes through the Value.
- **(c)** a ***“Type”***, which is one of the following: Product, Service, Relationship or Right.

The Value types are defined as:

A ***Product*** is an object.
A ***Service*** is a process.
A ***Relationship*** is a type of relationship that can be formed between two **Agents**.
A ***Right*** is a legally enforceable claim held by an **Agent**.

Value can transcend-and-include or be a part of another Value.

### 1.1.1 Tangible and Intangible Products

Every ***Product*** can be characterised as **Tangible** if it's a concrete object that can be touched or **Intangible** if it's a subtle object that can only be perceived indirectly.

#### 1.1.2 Fungible and Non-Fungible Products

If any pair or quantity of **Product Instances** are considered to be identical in specification and can be mutually substituted, then the **Product** is considered to be **Fungible**.

### 1.2 Creating and Controlling Value Definitions

Any Role can create a new Value Definition by publishing the decision and the Definition itself. This role automatically gains a Domain over this Definition, unless a Policy specifies otherwise.

### 1.3 Value Instances

Any specific and unique manifestation of Value in the Market can be captured and recorded as **Value Instance**.

### 1.4 Taxonomies

Taxonomies must be used to classify Value and Agents of the Market.

## Article 2: Market Foundations

### 2.1 Individuals and Organizations

The **Agents** in the Market are defined as **Organizations** and **Individuals**.

#### 2.1.1 Individual Definition

An ***“Individual”*** is a natural person. Individual definition consists of:

- **(a)* their legal name.

#### 2.1.1 Organization Definition

An ***“Organization*** is a legal person/entity, defined by:

- **(a)** its legal name.

### 2.2 Geography

A ***“Geography*** is specific part of the Market's physical dimension defined as:

- **(a)** its name.
- **(c)** its type.

Default geography types are as follows, ordered by depth:

- Planet
- Continent
- Continental Section
- Country
- Region
- City

## Article 3: Agreements

All Agents of the Market can make mutually beneficial ***"Agreements"*** defined as a contract duly executed and legally binding in the Market. The definition consists of:

- **(a)** a descriptive and unique title
- **(b)** a list of Agents who are a party to this agreement
- **(c)** the time and date (incl. the timezone) of the completion

## Article 4: Exchanges

***"Exchange"*** is a special type of ***Agreement*** in which the parties exchange explicitly defined sets of ***Value*** and/or **Value Instances**.

Depending on the perspective taken, an exchange can be a ***Purchase*** or ***Sale***.

### 4.1 Channels

All Exchanges take place through one of the transactional **Channels**, which can be any way that the actual agreement is made. The definition consists of:

- **(a)** its name.

#### 4.1.1 Awareness and Exchange Channels

Whenever a Channel is non-transactional, which means that Agents cannot make an Agreement through it, it is considered an Awareness Channel. All transactional Channels can be considered Awareness or Exchange Channels, depending on the context.

### 4.2 Offering Definition

A ***“Offering”*** is a Value Exchange proposition that can be opened or closed in the market. Offering definition consists of:

- **(a)** a descriptive name.
- **(b)** a ***“Purpose”***, which is a capacity, potential, or goal that specific Offering.
- **(d)** at least one or more Offering Components, referencing specific Value or Value Instance, each with their ***"Pricing"***.

The **Offering** can be opened for a specific timeframe.

## Article 5: Internal Market

By the virtue of stewarding the Market space (the "External" Market), the Organisation itself becomes the "Internal" Market and can make agreements and perform exchanges between its various Value Streams.

### 5.1 Value Stream Status

Any role or circle can gain a **Value Stream status** by any Circle Lead publishing the decision to do so and getting "No objection" from all other Circle Leads and Circle Reps of that role.

### 5.2 Value Stream Accountabilities

Every Value Stream gains additional accountabilities:

- Creating, systemizing and evolving Value relevant to the purpose
- Exchanging the relevant value on the external market via all possible channels
- Tracking best effort approximation of revenue, expenses and the resulting P&L

Each new Value Stream must have a Market Development role with purpose "Attract and connect our target audience with relevant value".
